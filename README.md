# What is MMTool_?

This project offers a versatile trading platform enabling users to connect accounts from various exchanges (such as Binance and Bybit) via API integration.

Once connected, users gain access to trading functionality (currently supporting spot trading) across multiple connected accounts or simultaneously across all accounts.

Additionally, the platform features functionalities including viewing trade histories, calculating profits for selected trades, exporting trade data to Excel, and monitoring portfolio performance across all accounts collectively or individually
